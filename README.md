### <u>Introduction</u>
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

### <u>Features</u>
| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Choose a work time, and a break time | You can select a work and a break time between 1 and 60 minutes. If you enter an other value, it will be trunc if it's a float number, or adjust to 1 or 60 if it's under limits. |
| Choose break or work periode | I added buttons to choose between the two periods. Usually, you start with work period, but I thought it was a good idea if you can choose to start with a break (to avoid to procrastinate for example). |
| Choose notifications | At the first lauch, you can accept or decline notifications. If you accept it, you will receive a notification when a period ends. |
| Start a timer | You can start the timer after all your features are set. |
| Stop a timer | If you suddently need to stop, or change the timer, you can press the reset button, which stops the timer and reset it. It's not in order to stop working ... :)) |
